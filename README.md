# Random-Walk-Simulation

This program simulates a random Walk in 2 dimensions, 

The first Variable 'n' represents the number of steps that will be simulated 

Meanwhile the 'Samples' variable will define the amount of times the simulation will be repeated

After finishing all desired simulations, the program will graph an Histogram with the final distance distributions on X, Y, and R^2
